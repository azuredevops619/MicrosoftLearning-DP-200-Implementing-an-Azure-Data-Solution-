## Basic transformations

1. Within the Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select **Workspace**, **Users**, and select **your username** (the entry with house icon).

2. In the blade that appears, select the **downwards pointing chevron next to your name**, and select **Import**.

3. On the Import Notebooks dialog, select **URL below** and paste in the following URL: 

```url
    https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-perform-basic-data-transformation-in-azure-databricks/blob/master/DBC/05.1-Basic-ETL.dbc?raw=true
```

4. Select **Import**.

5. A folder named **05.1-Basic-ETL** after the import should appear. Select that folder.

6. The folder will contain one or more notebooks that you can use to learn basic transformations using **scala** or **python**.

Follow the instructions within the notebook, until you've completed the entire notebook. Then continue with the remaining notebooks in order:

- **01-Course-Overview-and-Setup** - This notebook gets you started with your Databricks workspace.
- **02-ETL-Process-Overview** - This notebook contains exercises to help you query, large data files and visualize your results.
- **03-Connecting-to-Azure-Blob-Storage** - You perform basic aggregation and Joins in this notebook.
- **04-Connecting-to-JDBC** - This notebook lists the steps for accessing data from various sources using Databricks.
- **05-Applying-Schemas-to-JSON** - In this notebook you learn how to query JSON & Hierarchical Data with DataFrames
- **06-Corrupt-Record-Handling** - This notebook lists the exercises that help you understand how to create ADLS and use Databricks DataFrames to query and analyze this data.
- **07-Loading-Data-and-Productionalizing** - Here you use Databricks to query and analyze data stores in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
- **Parsing-Nested-Data** - This notebook is located in the Optional subfolder, and includes a sample project for you explore later on in your own time.

>[Note] You'll find corresponding notebooks within the Solutions subfolder. These contain completed cells for exercises that ask you to complete one or more challenges. Refer to these if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.
