ask 4: If time permits or post course review
If you have completed this lab early, the following sections provide links to content that can help you learn more about basic and advanced transformations in Azure.

If the url are inaccessible, there is a copy of the notebooks ion the Allfiles\Labfiles\Starter\DP-200.3\Post Course Review folder

Basic transformations

Within the Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select Workspace, Users, and select your username (the entry with house icon).

In the blade that appears, select the downwards pointing chevron next to your name, and select Import.

On the Import Notebooks dialog, select URL below and paste in the following URL:

    https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-perform-basic-data-transformation-in-azure-databricks/blob/master/DBC/05.1-Basic-ETL.dbc?raw=true
Select Import.

A folder named 05.1-Basic-ETL after the import should appear. Select that folder.

The folder will contain one or more notebooks that you can use to learn basic transformations using scala or python.

Follow the instructions within the notebook, until you've completed the entire notebook. Then continue with the remaining notebooks in order:

01-Course-Overview-and-Setup - This notebook gets you started with your Databricks workspace.
02-ETL-Process-Overview - This notebook contains exercises to help you query, large data files and visualize your results.
03-Connecting-to-Azure-Blob-Storage - You perform basic aggregation and Joins in this notebook.
04-Connecting-to-JDBC - This notebook lists the steps for accessing data from various sources using Databricks.
05-Applying-Schemas-to-JSON - In this notebook you learn how to query JSON & Hierarchical Data with DataFrames
06-Corrupt-Record-Handling - This notebook lists the exercises that help you understand how to create ADLS and use Databricks DataFrames to query and analyze this data.
07-Loading-Data-and-Productionalizing - Here you use Databricks to query and analyze data stores in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2.
Parsing-Nested-Data - This notebook is located in the Optional subfolder, and includes a sample project for you explore later on in your own time.
[Note] You'll find corresponding notebooks within the Solutions subfolder. These contain completed cells for exercises that ask you to complete one or more challenges. Refer to these if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.

Advanced transformations

Within the Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select Workspace, Users, and select your username (the entry with house icon).

In the blade that appears, select the downwards pointing chevron next to your name, and select Import.

On the Import Notebooks dialog, select URL below and paste in the following URL:

    https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-perform-advanced-data-transformation-in-azure-databricks/blob/master/DBC/05.2-Advanced-ETL.dbc?raw=true
Select Import.

A folder named 05.2-Advanced-ETL after the import should appear. Select that folder.

The folder will contain one or more notebooks that you can use to learn basic transformations using scala or python.

Follow the instructions within the notebook, until you've completed the entire notebook. Then continue with the remaining notebooks in order:

01-Course-Overview-and-Setup - This notebook gets you started with your Databricks workspace.
02-Common-Transformations - In this notebook you perform some common data transformation using Spark built-in functions.
03-User-Defined-Functions - In this notebook you perform custom transformation using user-defined functions.
04-Advanced-UDFs - In this notebook you use advanced user-defined functions to perform some complex data transformations.
05-Joins-and-Lookup-Tables - In this notebook you learn how to use standard and broadcast join for tables.
06-Database-Writes - This notebook contains exercises to write data to a number of target databases in parallel, storing the transformed data from your ETL job.
07-Table-Management - Here you handle managed and unmanaged tables to optimize your data storage.
Custom-Transformations - This notebook is located in the Optional subfolder, and includes a sample project for you to explore later on in your own time.
[Note] You'll find corresponding notebooks within the Solutions subfolder. These contain completed cells for exercises that ask you to complete one or more challenges. Refer to these if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.
