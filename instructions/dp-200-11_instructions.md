## Advanced transformations

1. Within the Workspace, using the command bar on the left, select **Workspace**, **Users**, and select **your username** (the entry with house icon).

2. In the blade that appears, select the **downwards pointing chevron next to your name**, and select **Import**.

3. On the Import Notebooks dialog, select **URL below** and paste in the following URL: 

```url
    https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/mslearn-perform-advanced-data-transformation-in-azure-databricks/blob/master/DBC/05.2-Advanced-ETL.dbc?raw=true
```

4. Select **Import**.

5. A folder named **05.2-Advanced-ETL** after the import should appear. Select that folder.

6. The folder will contain one or more notebooks that you can use to learn basic transformations using **scala** or **python**.

Follow the instructions within the notebook, until you've completed the entire notebook. Then continue with the remaining notebooks in order:

- **01-Course-Overview-and-Setup** - This notebook gets you started with your Databricks workspace.
- **02-Common-Transformations** - In this notebook you perform some common data transformation using Spark built-in functions.
- **03-User-Defined-Functions** - In this notebook you perform custom transformation using user-defined functions.
- **04-Advanced-UDFs** - In this notebook you use advanced user-defined functions to perform some complex data transformations.
- **05-Joins-and-Lookup-Tables** - In this notebook you learn how to use standard and broadcast join for tables.
- **06-Database-Writes** - This notebook contains exercises to write data to a number of target databases in parallel, storing the transformed data from your ETL job.
- **07-Table-Management** - Here you handle managed and unmanaged tables to optimize your data storage.
- **Custom-Transformations** - This notebook is located in the Optional subfolder, and includes a sample project for you to explore later on in your own time.

>[Note] You'll find corresponding notebooks within the Solutions subfolder. These contain completed cells for exercises that ask you to complete one or more challenges. Refer to these if you get stuck or simply want to see the solution.
